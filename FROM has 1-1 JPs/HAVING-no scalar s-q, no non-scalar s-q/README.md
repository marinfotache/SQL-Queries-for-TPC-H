### Parameters defining the current scenario are:
    * FROM has 1-1 JPs
    * groups may appear
    * HAVING-no scalar subqueries, no non-scalar subqueries

### Here is a typical query of this scenario:<br>



 SELECT LOWER(customer.c_phone) AS LOWER__customer__c_phone<br>&emsp; ,MIN(orders.o_shippriority) AS MIN__orders__o_shippriority<br>&emsp; ,MIN(orders.o_orderstatus) AS MIN__orders__o_orderstatus<br>&emsp; ,MIN(orders.o_orderkey) AS MIN__orders__o_orderkey<br>&emsp; ,MIN(LOG(2<br>&emsp; ,orders.o_custkey)) AS MIN__LOG__2__orders__o_custkey<br>FROM<br>&emsp; orders<br>&emsp;INNER JOIN customer ON orders.o_custkey = customer.c_custkey <br>WHERE<br>&emsp; orders.o_custkey <  247865 <br>GROUP BY<br>&emsp;  LOWER(customer.c_phone)  <br>HAVING<br>&emsp;  MIN(orders.o_shippriority) not in ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 )  or MIN(orders.o_orderkey) >  18920069   and MIN(orders.o_orderstatus) <=  'F'  <br>ORDER BY<br>&emsp; MIN(LOG(2<br>&emsp; ,orders.o_custkey)) DESC<br>&emsp; ,LOWER(customer.c_phone) DESC  <br>LIMIT 83

<br>
